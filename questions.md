## Title - Mia and the feedback loop

### **Question** :

Mia was crushing her thesis!

She was about to release a new neural network architecture that promised to raise the bar on image classification problems.

Mia did not start from scratch. She modified an existing model but added a key ingredient: feedback loops.

A feedback loop is when connections between units form a directed cycle, thus creating loops in the network. This gave Mia's network the ability to save information in the hidden layers.

Mia did a lot of research before deciding in favor of this architecture. She knew the advantages of her decision.

**Which was the architecture that Mia studied to learn about feedback loops?**

### **Choices** :

- Recurrent Neural Networks
- Convolutional Neural Network
- Multilayer Perceptron
- Radial Basis Function Network

## Title - Harper and the small gradients


### **Question** :

Harper's team is struggling with the deep neural network they have been building.

Unfortunately, during backpropagation, the gradient values of their network decrease dramatically as the process gets closer to the initial layers, preventing them from learning at the same pace as the last set of layers.

Harper knows their model suffers from the vanishing gradient problem. She decides to research every possible option to improve their model.

**Which of the following techniques will make Harper's model more robust to the vanishing gradient problem?**


### **Choices** :

- Harper should try ReLU as the activation function since it's well-known for mitigating the vanishing gradient problem.
- Harper should modify the model architecture to introduce Batch Normalization.
- Harper should make sure they are initializing the weights properly. For example, using He initialization should help with the vanishing gradient problem.
- Harper should increase the learning rate to avoid getting stuck in local minima and thus reduce the chance of suffering vanishing gradients.

## Title - Susan needs to make a decision


### **Question** :

The deadline is approaching, and Susan still hasn't decided which version of her classification model to deploy to production.

She experimented with different hyperparameters, and now she has two models that perform pretty well. 

Her problem is that none of these models is better than the other in every situation. One model has a higher recall but worse precision than the other. Susan can improve the precision by playing with different thresholds, but now the recall decreases.

**How can Susan decide which is the best overall model?**


### **Choices** :

- Susan should tune the thresholds until both have a recall of 95% and choose the one with higher precision.
- Susan should tune the thresholds until both have a precision of 95% and choose the one with a higher recall.
- Susan should compute the area under the curve for both models and choose the one with the higher value.
- There's no objective way to decide which model is best. Susan should pick either one of them.

## Title - Linear regression by hand


### **Question** :

The best way to learn something new is to rip the band-aid and tackle a problem from scratch.

Imagine you get a dataset with thousands of samples of houses sold in the U.S. over the last five years. We know the value of a few different features of each home and the price it was sold for. The goal is to build a simple model capable of predicting the price of a new house given those features.

A linear regression model seems like an excellent place to start. 

But you are not writing any code yet. You want to do this manually, starting with a matrix `X` containing the value of the features and a vector `w` containing the weights.

The next step is to multiply `X` and `w`, but you aren't sure about the result of this operation.

**Which of the following better describes the result of multiplying `X` and `w`?**


### **Choices** :

- The result will be a vector `y` containing the actual price of each house as provided in the dataset.
- The result will be a vector `y` containing the predicted price of each house.
- The result will be a matrix `y` containing the actual price of each house and the features from the matrix `X`.
- The result will be a matrix `y` containing the predicted price of each house and the features from the matrix `X`.

## Title - A batch of rotated pictures


### **Question** :

After looking at the last batch of images, the problem was apparent:

Customers were taking pictures and sending them with different degrees of rotation. The Convolutional Neural Network that Jessica built wasn't ready to handle this.

She knew she needed to do something about it.

A couple of meetings later, Jessica knew what the right solution was. It took some time for the team to agree, but they had a plan now.

**Which of the following approaches could Jessica have proposed?**


### **Choices** :

- Extending the pipeline with a data preprocessing step to properly rotate every image coming from the customer before giving the data to the model.
- Extending the model with a layer capable of rotating the data to the correct position.
- Extending the training data with samples of images rotated across the full 360-degree spectrum to build some rotation invariability into the model.
- Configuring the network correctly since Convolutional Neural Networks are translation and rotation invariant and should handle these images correctly.

## Title - Alex's model is not doing well


### **Question** :

Alex is a Machine Learning Engineer working for a new photo-sharing startup.

His team started building a model to predict the likeability of every new image posted on the platform. They collected some data and built a simple classification model.

Unfortunately, Alex quickly realizes that the model doesn't perform well. He notices that the training error is not as low as expected.

**What do you think is happening with Alex's model?**


### **Choices** :

- It's very likely that the model suffers from high bias and is underfitting. This usually happens when the model is not complex enough and can't capture the relationship between input and output variables.
- It's very likely that the model suffers from low bias and is underfitting. This usually happens when the model is not complex enough and can't capture the relationship between input and output variables.
- It's very likely that the model suffers from high variance and is overfitting. This usually happens when the model is too complex and captures the noise of the data.
- It's very likely that the model suffers from low variance and is overfitting. This usually happens when the model is too complex and captures the noise of the data.

## Title - Behind Gradient Descent


### **Question** :

It's 2030, and neural networks are taught at high schools worldwide.

It makes sense. Few subjects are as impactful to society as machine learning, so it's only appropriate that schools get students onboard from a very early age.

Lillian spent a long time learning about gradient descent and how it's an optimization algorithm frequently used in machine learning applications.

This is Lillian's last exam. The first question asks her to describe in a few words how gradient descent works.

**Which of the following statements is a sensible description of how the algorithm works?**


### **Choices** :

- Gradient descent identifies the minimum loss and adjusts every parameter proportionally to this loss.
- Gradient descent searches every possible combination of parameters to find the optimal loss.
- Gradient descent identifies the slope in all directions and adjusts the parameters to move them in the direction of the negative slope.
- Gradient descent identifies the slope in all directions and adjusts the parameters to move them in the direction of the slope.

## Title - A recommendation for Adrienne


### **Question** :

Kaggle looked like the perfect opportunity for Adrienne to start practicing machine learning.

She went online and started listening to the conversations about popular Kagglers. One particular topic caught her attention: They kept discussing different ways to create ensembles.

Adrienne knew that ensemble learning is a powerful technique where you combine the decisions from multiple models to improve the overall performance. She had never used ensembles before, so she decided this was the place to start.

**Which of the following are valid ensemble techniques that Adrienne could study?**


### **Choices** :

- Max Voting: Multiple models make predictions for each sample. The final prediction is the one produced by the majority of the models.
- Weighted Voting: Multiple models make predictions for each sample, and each model is assigned a different weight. The final prediction considers the importance of the model in determining the final vote.
- Simple Averaging: Multiple models make predictions for each sample. The final prediction is the average of all of those predictions.
- Weighted Averaging: Multiple models make predictions for each sample, and each model is assigned a different weight. The final prediction is the average of all of those predictions, considering the importance of each model.

## Title - Sometimes, small is better


### **Question** :

Fynn is new to a team working on a neural network model. Unfortunately, they haven't been happy with the results so far.

Fynn thinks that he found the problem: they chose a batch size as large as it fits into the GPU memory. His colleagues believe this is the right approach, but Fynn believes a smaller batch size will be better.

**What would be good arguments to support Fynn's suspicion?**


### **Choices** :

- A smaller batch size is more computationally effective.
- A smaller batch size reduces overfitting because it increases the noise in the training process.
- A smaller batch size reduces overfitting because it decreases the noise in the training process.
- A smaller batch size can improve the generalization of the model.

But Reese knows that for Linear Regression to work, she must consider several assumptions about the problem.

**Which of the following are some of the assumptions that Reese should make for Linear Regression to be a good candidate for her baseline?**


### **Choices** :

- The relationship between the features in the data and the target variable must be linear.
- The features in the data are highly correlated between them.
- The features in the data and the target variable are not noisy.
- There must not be more than two relevant features plus the target variable.
